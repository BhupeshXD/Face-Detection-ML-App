# LGMVIP-Face-Detector-ML

Everyone has listened about the face detection program built using python but here we are going to create an android app using machine learning kit on firebase which will do the same stuff as the python program.

It will be a simple app with a simple UI in which the user will be greeted with a camera button on the home page to open a camera and then it will detect the face and show the result in an alert dialog box.

For Best Results install on your mobile phone.

***Note*** : One Error was there in a app about total number faces --- error fixed --- no more issues.
